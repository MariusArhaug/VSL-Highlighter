# Very Simple Highlighter

This is a simple syntax highlighter for the "vsl" (very simple language) language introduced in NTNU's Compiler Construction course `TDT4205`.
It is still a work in progress :)

## Install

You can visit the vscode marketplace [here](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=MariusArhaug.vsl-lang) and learn how to download and install.

## Features

It currently only implements simple highlighting tokens for other themes to pick up on.

These are for operators, assignements and keywords

More to be added whenever I have the time :)
